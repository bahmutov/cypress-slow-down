> Slow down your Cypress tests

Watch the introduction to this plugin in the video [Slow Down Cypress Tests](https://youtu.be/lxx-_nAkQo8). For advanced usage, see the lessons in my [Cypress Plugins course](https://cypress.tips/courses/cypress-plugins).

## Install

Add this NPM package to your project

```text
# install using NPM
$ npm i -D cypress-slow-down
# or install using Yarn
$ yarn add -D cypress-slow-down
```

Include the plugin and call its function from your spec or support file

```js
// cypress/e2e/spec.cy.js
// https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-slow-down
import { slowCypressDown } from 'cypress-slow-down'
// slow down each command by the default amount
// which is 1 second
slowCypressDown()
```

## Options

You can control the delay before each command (in milliseconds)

```js
// when calling the slowCypressDown function
slowCypressDown(1000)
```

You can also control the delay using the [Cypress environment variable](https://on.cypress.io/environment-variables) `commandDelay`.

```js
// cypress.config.js
const { defineConfig } = require('cypress')

module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    env: {
      // https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-slow-down
      commandDelay: 500,
    },
  },
})
// cypress/e2e/spec.cy.js
import { slowCypressDown } from 'cypress-slow-down'
slowCypressDown() // slows down each command by 500ms
```

## Disable the slow down

You can disable the default slowdown by using `false`. For example, from the command line you can pass the boolean value:

```
$ npx cypress run --env commandDelay=false
```

Or you can use the [process (OS) environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable)

```
$ CYPRESS_commandDelay=false npx cypress run
```

Or you can use the `cypress.config.js` to disable the slowdown

```js
// cypress.config.js
const { defineConfig } = require('cypress')

module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    env: {
      // https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-slow-down
      commandDelay: false,
    },
  },
})
```

## Change the command delay from DevTools

Because this plugin uses [cypress-plugin-config](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-plugin-config) to read the command delay option, you can change its value or disable the plugin completely from the DevTools console using the command `Cypress.setPluginConfigValue('commandDelay', <value>)`

The re-run the tests by pressing the key "R" or clicking "Run All Tests" button.
